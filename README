CSV Combiner 
---------------
command line program that takes in CSV files as arguments and combines them while adding a column that states the filename from which that row came from. The result is outputed in a new csv file. 
 

Input & Output
---------------
This is the format at which I expect to see

$ node main.js ./fixtures/accessories.csv ./fixtures/clothing.csv combined.csv

All of the CSV files between main.js and the last CSV file are the files that will be merged and the last CSV file is the file that will hold the results. 

Can combine mutiple csv files. An example of 3 files is shown below. 

$ node main.js ./fixtures/accessories.csv ./fixtures/clothing.csv ./fixtures/household_cleaners.csv combined.csv
