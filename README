CSV Combiner 
---------------
command line program that takes in csv files as arguments and and combines the csv files while adding a column that states the filename from which that row came from. The results is outputs in a new csv file. 

Input & Output
---------------
This is the format at which I expect to see

$ node main.js ./fixtures/accessories.csv ./fixtures/clothing.csv combined.csv

The first two CSV files are the files that will be merged and the last CSV file is the file that will hold the results.
